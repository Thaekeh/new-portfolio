### Designing UI components 
Sometimes when you’re creating a website or webapp, you want to change some of the designs as you go along. 
A button that doesn’t feel quite right here and a slider that doesn’t quite match the brand’s style can be very annoying.<br>
That is why I made this small Chrome extension. 
 
### What does it do? 
Quite simply: it allows you to design a component from your browser without using any CSS. 
When you are done with designing, you can copy the CSS and paste it right into your code. 
It uses a bunch of sliders and color pickers to allow for easy customization. 
You can also easily copy and paste colors by pressing the buttons next to the color pickers. 
 

### What did I learn while making this extension? 
There are a few things that I’ve learned from this small project.

<ol>
    <li>How easy it is to get started with making your own Chrome extensions. 
Apart from making the manifest.json file for adding some settings to the extension, it is the same process as creating a website. 
Just add a HTML and JS file and you’re ready to start building. </li>
    <li>How to work with jQuery. 
Before making this extension, I didn’t have any experience with jQuery. 
The reason I chose to use jQuery is for the simple DOM manipulation options that it offers. 
This DOM manipulation was needed to use the copy & paste functions.</li>
</ol>
<br>

### Is this the final version?
Definitely not. 
Right now, it is on version 1.0. 
I’m planning to add a lot of different customizable UI components to the extension. 
And perhaps I will add the option of manipulating components on a website. 
This way you can see the actual component being changed in the context where you want it to be.
